* Hello,
My name is Jake, I'm a student at Youngstown State University. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science.

This is where I share some of my projects and information.

Please, look around and consider contributing or contacting me.

I believe that self awareness and understanding of motivation are the most important skills one can cultivate in their lifetime.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Why do you do, the things that you do? Does it align with your beliefs? And are those right?
#+END_QUOTE

I believe that the world today has a social problem, in that we do things to be seen. In reality, no one cares what you do, but you. It's nice to share achievement, but that's become the goal in itself. As such, I like to keep things simple, honest, and easy to digest around here.

Here is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmzeWs4uJ1g][presentation]] by Protesilaos Stavrou on the subject.
	
I believe in sharing information and empowering others. Information is the most powerful thing man has, and what you do with it shows your true character and beliefs. This is my primary reason for distributing free software and putting myself on the internet. To give back, act as a beacon and source for these ideas, and attact others who want to do the same.

  - System crafting!
- Commandline - I love a nice one-liner.
  - Bash scripting
  - Want to become fluent with grep, sed, and awk.
- C and C++
  - Trying to get into SICP/Lisp, Clojure, and Python.
- Emacs, Vim, and Doom Emacs

    - By extension LaTeX
- Custom ergonomic, split, mechanical keyboards.
